This is a project from my Arduino starter series.

In this project I'm going to make a Love-O-Meter, another project from the Arduino Projects Book. Perhaps this should have been made on Valentines day. Anyways, its simple

My code differs slightly from the Arduino Projects Book version, however the result is the same. 

This project is ideal for beginners who want to grasp the basics of Arduino programming and prototyping. Enjoy!

######Project Requirements
Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila 
USB cable to program Arduino 
Breadboard 
Three LEDS (Two red and one green) 
Three 220 Ohm Resistors 
One Temperature sensor (I'm using the [TMP36](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/TMP35_36_37.pdf))
Wires to power the components on the breadboard
